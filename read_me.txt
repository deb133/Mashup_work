Trying to order the dictionary by average, highscore and total inspections.

Since last class I have tried to understand object_pairs_hook, json.load and json.dump, as I understood from research this was the most locigcal way to complete the homework.

However, the json python library and other srouces have not clarified much since I have concistently had a problem at line 180 in my code...
